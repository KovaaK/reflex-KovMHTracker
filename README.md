LUA script to show how much damage you can take until you lose the Mega Health Buff.

See: http://www.gfycat.com/PointlessPowerfulImago (notice the number just below "Megahealth" on the bottom left side of the HUD)

Known bug: if you lose health in the same frame that you grab an armor or health, the tracker won't notice the loss.  This applies mostly when you are at 200 health and sitting on 5h shards, but it should be pretty rare in real combat.
